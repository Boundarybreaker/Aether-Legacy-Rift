# Aether Legacy [![Discord](https://img.shields.io/badge/Discord-join-7289DA.svg)](https://discord.gg/tja2Kxr)

The original mod has been updated for the current Minecraft versions

## Summary 

Aether II is indeed an amazing mod and shall continue to grow into something even greater. However, some people haven't played the original Aether mostly due to it being outdated and unavailable to the general public through official ways. Aether Legacy is a port of Aether I that allows people to play the original experience on newer versions of Minecraft with multiplayer support.

## Goal

The goal of this project is to help show how much the Aether has grown from then to now. With this project it should help bring more appreciation towards Aether II and the amount of dedication Gilded Games is putting out to make it as outstanding as it can ever be.

## Disclaimer

I am only one person so if you find any bugs I do apologize. Please list all bugs on the issue tracker and a patch will be done every other week.
